Whether setting tables, communicating with the kitchen, interacting and serving guests, or cleaning work areas and supplies, the Guest Service Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.   No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.   The pay range for this position is $17.20 to $17.20 per hour and may offer 401(k) plan, earned paid time off and/or sick leave, and other wellness benefits. Benefits may be subject to generally applicable eligibility, waiting period, contribution, and other requirements and conditions.    Marriott International is an equal opportunity employer. We believe in hiring a diverse workforce and sustaining an inclusive, people-first culture. We are committed to non-discrimination on any protected basis, such as disability and veteran status, or any other basis covered under applicable law.  Marriott International considers for employment qualified applicants with criminal histories consistent with applicable federal, state and local law.Marriott International portfolio of brands includes both JW Marriott and Marriott Hotels.

About Brigaid: Founded by former Noma head chef Dan Giusti, Brigaid is a startup that began challenging the school food status quo by putting professional chefs into public schools to cook fresh, wholesome food from scratch. In 2016, we launched our first pilot program with the New London Public School district in New London, Connecticut. Since then, we’ve partnered with several more school districts around the country and expanded our reach into institutional kitchens of all kinds, equipping chefs to work within the parameters of federally-funded food assistance programs to provide organizations with practical solutions and hands-on training that facilitate improved outcomes for those they serve. We encourage you to learn more about our work by visiting our website, chefsbrigaid.com, and our Instagram, @brigaid. 
About Position: Brigaid has partnered with the Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD), a diverse public school district that serves 15,300 students from the cities of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and San Jose, and operates 27 school kitchens for its 28 schools (two schools share a kitchen). Since 2017, the district has also maintained its own farm, and produce harvested from the farm is regularly featured on the menus and used for nutrition education, including rainbow carrots, romaine, cauliflower, blood oranges, squash, and herbs. 
At this point, Brigaid has assessed all 27 of the district’s school kitchens. SCUSD has now prioritized hiring a Program Chef to help the district full-time to improve the overall quality of food offerings, maximize the value of current infrastructure, and increase student satisfaction. The Program Chef will spearhead these tasks and serve as a long-term fixture in the district, working closely with both district leadership and kitchen teams on the ground.

In the fall of 2021, Farmshop launched an Artisanal Breads line, headed by Peter Resch to much adoration. Within less than a year of its launch, Farmshop’s bread production grew to over 1,000 loaves per day with placements in over 50 locations, including  twenty-five Trader Joe’s grocery stores in Southern California.
