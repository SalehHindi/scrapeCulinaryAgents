About Lost Bread:
Our goal is to make delicious/nutritious bread widely accessible, drawing from and strengthening local food systems. Since 2017, we have purchased well over 500,000lb of local grain, and also produced a series of zines that explore the bounty of grain grown in the mid-Atlantic region through recipes, stories and journalism. Food & Wine Magazine and The Food Network both named us one of the best bakeries in the country in 2020, during which we also produced well over 100,000 loaves for COVID-19 related hunger relief packages. In 2022, we moved into our current bakery space, purchased a second stone mill, and began wholesaling and distributing our freshly milled flours.",Required Years of Experience2 years,"Compensation DetailsCompensation: Salary ($52,000.00 - $58,000.00)Benefits & Perks: Health Insurance, Paid Time Off",Required Skills,True,False

",Post Haste,,Sous Chef,Full Time • Salary ($48k - $55k),"Job DetailsPost Haste is opening a New American restaurant and cocktail bar in the Fishtown/East Kensington area that focuses on sourcing locally and seasonally.  Our concept is to create a world class cocktail bar with a robust food program, which reduces the typical restaurant carbon footprint by sourcing all ingredients as locally as possible. This means we won't be importing any of our spirits or produce, but that we will be supporting our local farmers, distillers and makers, while having a great time every night.  We are beginning our search for a Sous Chef to work with the Chef de Cuisine, Elise Black. The Sous Chef will work with Chef to finalize the kitchen’s prep and ordering systems, as well as kitchen culture. They will be trained on execution of the opening menu, while helping to build a kitchen team. We are looking to hire someone who will embody our core values of local sourcing practices, and who is committed to contributing to the development of seasonal dishes that highlight the produce and ingredients of the Mid-Atlantic. Our concept is unique so this individual should be forward thinking, with the ability to think outside the box and break some traditional cuisine rules. It is an excellent opportunity for a creative, passionate, team-oriented individual with lead line cook or other leadership experience, to reach the next level in their career at a forward-thinking and fun restaurant / cocktail bar. 
The food menu will emphasize classic European influences, while utilizing products exclusively from the Mid-Atlantic and surrounding areas, aiming to source as much as possible from within a 600 mile radius. The menu is designed for sharing and will feature a number of small and large share plates, as well as entrees. It aims to showcase vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes, with a majority of the menu being veg friendly. We will not serve red meat, but there is an emphasis on sustainable seafood as well as whole animal usage of pork/duck/lamb. There is cross-utilization of product creatively built into the menu that will require the staff to work more deliberately when preparing ingredients.
All experiences and backgrounds will be valid in the Post Haste kitchen and the idea that everyone brings something to the table will be at the core of what we do. There will be zero-tolerance for any and all forms of discrimination or harassment.  The fundamental values of Post Haste’s kitchen will be Respect, Inclusivity, Communication, Excellence, and Sustainability. Job Duties

In conjunction with the CDC, oversee the execution of the menu on a daily basis- including working stations, training cooks, running expo as needed, and opening or closing the kitchen. 
Oversee kitchen and team on a daily basis, helping the CDC to efficiently execute all prep activities and service preparations in a timely fashion. Time management will be a major part of running a dual prep and service kitchen.

Participate in ordering, inventory, and food costing/budgets. Build and maintain relationships with vendors.
Effectively communicate with kitchen staff as well as front of house managers. Assist with hiring, training, developing and appraising staff. Take appropriate, constructive corrective action as necessary on a timely basis. 
There will be an emphasis on education, sharing knowledge, and helping each other, but the sous chef’'s job will also be proper delegation and a communal sense of shared responsibility. Strong, friendly follow-up will be necessary on tasks delegated to ensure proper results.
Participate in manager meetings when required, as well as scheduled bi-weekly check-ins with chef and other kitchen staff. 


Job Expectations

Interest and knowledge of sustainability practices, with creative thinking in ingredient preparation and preservation, especially in relation to food waste.
Experience and passion about vegetarian and vegan dishes. General knowledge of French and classic European techniques/dishes/sauces/verbiage is preferred. 
The Sous Chef will be expected to display integrity and promptness in decision making, confidence in directing the team, and will work clean.

The Sous will contribute to on-going seasonal menu planning with the Chef to determine purchasing specifications, product needs, seasonal pantry/preserves planning, cross-utilization, and menu development. Creative opportunities for the Sous Chef and other kitchen staff are built into the menu, as well as the opportunity for the Sous to develop the future brunch menu with Chef. 
We are looking for a Sous Chef who will approach this position with care for the needs of others- including our company, management, team, and our guests. Post Haste will be a collaborative team effort in all aspects, with “an all hands on deck” attitude and the awareness that we all individually contribute to the bigger picture. Our part of the bigger picture is the successful flow of our kitchen and the subsequent outcomes that help set the entire restaurant up for success. 
Adherence to Post Haste's guidelines and procedures for effective decision-making and teaching will be important.  This is a collaborative environment, and we emphasize free flowing communication, but certain managers will maintain the final decision after consultation.
Contribute positively to Post Haste’s “Cuisine Culture.”  This includes (of course not limited to) the previously mentioned kitchen values, as well as: scheduled/provided staff meal, cross-training on all stations, a dual prep and service team environment, open and detailed communication, staggered schedules for longer days off, monthly rotating schedules for extra days off, and seasonal menu planning meetings as a team.

Goldie also serves the falafel salad, shawarma spiced French fries, and tehina shakes (non-dairy) like Turkish coffee and mint chocolate flavors.
Goldie hosts 3 locations: its Flagship at 1526 Sansom Street in Rittenhouse Square; inside Franklin's Table Food Hall located at 34th & Walnut streets on the University of Pennsylvania campus; and will soon reopen inside Whole Foods Market Center City, located at 2101 Pennsylvania Avenue.
