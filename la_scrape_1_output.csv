",Jeune et Jolie,,General Manager,Full Time • Salary ($85k - $95k),"Job Details
Jeune et Jolie, a Michelin 1 Star restaurant located in Carlsbad, CA, is seeking a compassionate, experienced, and optimistic leader to be our next General Manager. 


ABOUT YOU
The General Manager role at Jeune et Jolie requires a leader with a deep passion for hospitality, deserving of a driven and dedicated team of amazing humans, who understands that we cannot take great care of our guests if we do not first take great care of our employees.  

There are some essential characteristics we look for in every individual we work with, and these attributes must shine even more brightly in our leaders.  They are: Curiosity, Passion, Altruism, Joy, Reliability, and Stage Presence. 


Curiosity. A curious leader looks for ways to learn, to improve, and to listen to criticism. Someone who looks for the root of issues, who thinks of novel solutions, new ways dazzle our guests, etc.  Staying curious is a fundamental ingredient for progress.



Passion. Without it, nothing sings.  Caring deeply, getting excited, and loving sharing our passions with others is what makes this all so much fun.



Altruism. Generosity of spirit, and care for our community of employees, guests and neighbors. This work is about human beings, and the communities we are here to serve. We require people who share the desire to care for others and nurture relationships.



Joy. The hospitality business is the work of welcoming others and creating environments in which they can experience joy.  Embracing that, leaning into it, and reveling in it should also bring us our own sense of purpose and joy. 



Reliability.  Being dependable, steadfast and steady means you are someone others can count on.



Stage Presence.  Although a great amount of this work is about listening, you also need to be able to tell a story, drive the conversation, and captivate your audience, whether it be you colleagues or your guests. 



Experience doesn’t count for everything, but it does count, so we will only consider candidates who have a minimum of 3 years experience managing a high-level restaurant (Michelin, James Beard, Relais & Chateaux, etc.) in a senior leadership position.  

Additionally, we require both grace and grit.  Fine-dining sensibilities, and an ability and desire to meet things head on.  The GM must thrive on the pressure of responsibility, never shirking from it, nor from opportunities to clearly express expectations, to lead, to coach and to mentor our team. 

You must be dedicated to the restaurant and hospitality business, and know how to lead a team, control the numbers, delight our guests and solve problems.  You need to be able to create and implement systems, mentor junior managers and leaders, and ensure that the restaurant is always evolving and growing. Does that mean you need to have all the answers?  No. But do you need to have ideas?  Absolutely.


ABOUT THE RESTAURANT
Led by Chef Eric Bost, Jeune et Jolie reimagines French food through the vibrant lens of our Southern Californian landscape.  With a 4-course tasting menu experience celebrating the moment, our team utilizes delicious, responsibly sourced ingredients to create food that focuses on our pristine surrounding waters and some of the world’s best seasonally-driven produce. 

Jeune et Jolie is a home for the community- the community of those who gather together each evening to provide real hospitality, incredible food and drink, and thoughtful service.  We are also home for the community that exists outside of our doors,  one that joins us to gather around the table to enjoy compelling and delicious meals, to share memorable experiences, to have meaningful conversations, to celebrate, to laugh and to connect.  Our hospitality is rooted in the genuine concern for others, and the desire to make our guests feel welcome. 

We believe in what E.M. Statler said so many years ago, ""Life is service – the one who progresses is the one who gives his fellow men a little more – a little better service."" We are obsessed with hospitality and with service.  We are obsessed with the effect providing good food and drink, gracious hospitality and a welcoming space can have on a community.  When it all goes right, a restaurant can become an important part of that community's story.

At the end of the day, we just think that this work is really special and incredibly fun. Why else do it?

So if this sounds like somewhere you belong, we look forward to hearing from you.


Yours truly,

Jeune et Jolie

Job Title: Lead Line Cook

Roberta’s Culver City has been very lucky to have such a dedicated kitchen crew over the years with very little turnover.  As is inevitable, some of our people are moving on to new things in the Spring, and we’ve got some shifts to fill - especially in pizza world where we’re busiest.  Here’s a list of what we offer since we’ll probably be hiring more than 1 person. 
- Neapolitan style pizza - Being the Friday night oven cook at Roberta’s means you can cook pizza anywhere on planet Earth. Our doughs are all naturally leavened, so if you’re comfortable with a thermometer and a scale, you’ll fit right in. Dedicated pizza cooks mostly make pizza, but we love cross training pizza cooks and our more traditional line cooks.  @anconagram takes all things pizza pretty seriously, so not a lot of cutting corners - that’s okay; they’re round!

- Composed farmer’s market dishes - and Santa Monica farmer’s market runs twice per week, so if that’s your jam, we’d love to talk.  @eatblanca loves veggies as much as meat.

- Dry aging and charcuterie - beef striploins age between 70 and 100 days We age pork middles, duck, sometimes lamb.  Mostly cooked off the wood grill, but sometimes roasted.  Our burger is ground daily and cut with dry-aged beef fat. We’ve cured prosciutto, ‘nduja, copa, lardo, pancetta, duck prosciutto in the past and are open to new ideas.

- We love projects and we love to grow our menu.  Pickles, vinegars, garums, fermented stinky stuff - If you have an idea for a project, let’s talk. 

- Health insurance after 90 days, staff discounts, and world travel for the A-students. 

QUALIFICATIONS:

- Should have at least 1 year of kitchen experience and think of this as their career - though a good attitude is the most important skill of all.
- Pride in how clean and efficient you work - it’s a small space that cranks out a lot of food
- Works hygienically - open kitchen standards apply
- Must be able to stand on their feet for 8+ hours and lift 50lbs

Opened in Brooklyn, New York in 2008, Roberta’s changed the pizza game. They quickly became a mecca for pizza and culture. Shortly after, they opened Blanca, which received 2 Michelin stars. Roberta’s does high profile pop ups in NYC, LA, Miami among other cities.

Roberta’s Culver City has been very lucky to have such a dedicated kitchen crew over the years with very little turnover.  As is inevitable, some of our people are moving on to new things in the Spring, and we’ve got some shifts to fill - especially in pizza world where we’re busiest.  Here’s a list of what we offer since we’ll probably be hiring more than 1 person. 
- Neapolitan style pizza - Being the Friday night oven cook at Roberta’s means you can cook pizza anywhere on planet Earth. Our doughs are all naturally leavened, so if you’re comfortable with a thermometer and a scale, you’ll fit right in. Dedicated pizza cooks mostly make pizza, but we love cross training pizza cooks and our more traditional line cooks.  @anconagram takes all things pizza pretty seriously, so not a lot of cutting corners - that’s okay; they’re round!

- Composed farmer’s market dishes - and Santa Monica farmer’s market runs twice per week, so if that’s your jam, we’d love to talk.  @eatblanca loves veggies as much as meat.

- Dry aging and charcuterie - beef striploins age between 70 and 100 days We age pork middles, duck, sometimes lamb.  Mostly cooked off the wood grill, but sometimes roasted.  Our burger is ground daily and cut with dry-aged beef fat. We’ve cured prosciutto, ‘nduja, copa, lardo, pancetta, duck prosciutto in the past and are open to new ideas.

- We love projects and we love to grow our menu.  Pickles, vinegars, garums, fermented stinky stuff - If you have an idea for a project, let’s talk. 

- Health insurance after 90 days, staff discounts, and world travel for the A-students. 

QUALIFICATIONS:

- Should have at least 1 year of kitchen experience and think of this as their career - though a good attitude is the most important skill of all.
- Pride in how clean and efficient you work - it’s a small space that cranks out a lot of food
- Works hygienically - open kitchen standards apply
- Must be able to stand on their feet for 8+ hours and lift 50lbs

Opened in Brooklyn, New York in 2008, Roberta’s changed the pizza game. They quickly became a mecca for pizza and culture. Shortly after, they opened Blanca, which received 2 Michelin stars. Roberta’s does high profile pop ups in NYC, LA, Miami among other cities.
